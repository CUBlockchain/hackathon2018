    <h2>About the Event</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">We are extremely excited to announce the very first CU Blockchain Hackathon coming to 
        the University of Colorado at Boulderâ€™s Idea Forge this April 14th and 15th! Seeing as the closest collegiate hackathon 
        to the University of Colorado Boulder is 500 miles away, CU Blockchain aims to build off the steam generated from the 
        HackCU hackathon in February. This concept was created by members of a quickly growing campus club to expedite the adoption 
        rate of blockchain technology.  The club quickly grew to 100+ members with various guest pitches from some of the biggest 
        projects in the space. Former members of the club have gone on to land major positions at some of the most innovative projects 
        in the space.</p>
      <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">Through the CU Blockchain hackathon we hope to offer a variety of internship opportunities 
        to students along with education workshops for hackers of all ages. Modeled after the format of ETHDenver, we will be hosting 
        a variety of highly demanded panels from respected companies in the blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, this hackathon provides 
        a perfect opportunity for companies to recruit the youngest talent from the ground up. HackCU gave light to many talented developers 
        who have gone on to contribute immensely to major companies such as Coinbase, Consensys, and the City of Zion.  We aim to foster 
        innovation and creativity through a community of students who are motivated  to make a lasting difference in the world, by 
        connecting them with other passionate hackers, brilliant mentors, and the best companies.</p>
      <p class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-10">This February, more than 600 students arrived in Boulder for 24 hours of teamwork, creativity, 
        and immense determination to produce marketable technology. This April, CU Blockchain will be hosting its first ever annual blockchain 
        hackathon. This event aims to bring together over 300 of the best hackers  from across the country to the University of Colorado 
        Boulder inspiring community. </p>
